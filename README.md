Hi reader, my name is Lily Wu. While I enjoy eating pickles and other green vegetables, celery is an absolute non-starter. They say your tastebuds change every 7 years, so maybe I should try celery again. Despite my distain for celery, I really appreciate a good minestrone soup that has softened celery in it. On a different note, I believe dandelions are highly underrated. Often, the public classifies the growth of dandelions as a nuisance. However, this flora should be held in higher regard. They are the wish givers and hope providers of on-passers. I think there is such beauty in the tenacity dandelions encapsulate, growing through concrete cement and the most barren places.
